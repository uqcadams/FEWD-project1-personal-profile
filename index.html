        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a challenge-driven young professional who has sought adventure and opportunity around the world. Working in fields as diverse as education, scuba diving, eco-tourism, and politics, I have a firm track record of tackling new experiences with enthusiasm and vigor.</p>
        <p>My adventurous drive has taken me around the world. I've lived and worked in Australia, Italy, the UK, Malaysia, and New York. Separately, I've explored South-East Asia, Africa, and Europe as a solo, independent backpacker. I crave the unknown, I thrive in foreign and unusual environments, and I never shy from making new friends and acquaintances along the way.</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Living in New York as an Advisor to Former Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Kevin Rudd</li>
          <li>Completing my Divemaster certification alongside the Bajau Laut "Sea Nomads" on a remote island in Malaysian Borneo</li>
          <li>Travelling overland across Africa with just a backpack and camera in hand</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm working on developing a mobile skillset that will allow me to work remotely as a "digital nomad," while continuing my exploration of the world.</p>
        <p>I'm achieving this by further developing my skills in the following:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>TESOL (Teaching English)</li>
          <li>Scuba dive instructing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to combine my passions for ocean and marine conservation with web development - to freelance for coastal communities around the world to develop websites that promote eco-tourism and conservation.</p>
