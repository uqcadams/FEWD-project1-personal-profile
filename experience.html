            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>Tertiary</h3>
            <p>The majority of my tertiary education has taken place at The University of Queensland, St Lucia campus, in Brisbane, Australia. I have completed short courses at Queensland University of Technology, and visited Harvard, MIT, and Boston University in the United States.</p>

                <p><strong>University of Queensland, 2020</strong> - <em>This degree explored methods for designing user interactions with technology. Most of the coursework was based around research methods for determining user needs and requirements, and how these could be incorporated into the design of new products, services, and technology systems.</em></p>

                <p><strong>University of Queensland, 2015</strong> - <em>This degree explores the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning within the tertiary education sector. My graduate thesis explored ways to improve student engagement in online learning platforms. This culminated in the total redesign of the course "POLS2501: Human Rights and International Politics," a project case study wherein I evaluated learning outcomes from internal and external offerings of the same course.</em></p>

                <p><strong>University of Queensland, 2011</strong> - <em>My first foray into the realm of international relations and political science. I completed an extended major in International Relations, with a minor in Peace and Conflict Studies, formalizing a passion for learning more about the world in which we live. My honours thesis investigated ways in which national political identity was invoked in constitutional interpretation when responding to non-violent, ideologically motivated extremism that attempted to undermine and subvert democracy and the rule of law. My specializations at the time extended to political subversion, free speech, and the conditions under which emergency laws could be enacted to suppress speech acts that acted counter to the "public good" - however that was defined.</em></p>

                <p>I took a brief career break to work as a scuba divemaster on a remote island off the coast of Malaysian Borneo called "Palau Mabul". I'd been drawn to this island as it was immediately next to Sipadan, an island that had been subject to an international territorial dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia. Mabul was home to a community of Bajau Laut "Sea Nomads," who offered a unique insight into the lives of stateless people in the 21st century.</p>
